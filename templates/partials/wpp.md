# Open WhatsApp conversation without saving to contacts

I have a creative cousin. He uses WhatsApp a lot, and he is lazy.  
He was tired of adding random people to his contact list just to open a WhatsApp conversation with them.  
Sometimes you just need to message and you don't want to save on the agenda.  
I liked the idea and verified there weren't many clean solutions to do this.  

[So here is my take.](start_whatsapp.html)

You can check the code <a href="https://github.com/alexandremcosta/start_whatsapp/blob/main/index.html">here</a>. It's very simple!  
You can add to your phone home screen, and it will feature a nice black icon :).
