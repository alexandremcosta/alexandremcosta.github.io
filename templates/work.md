### Bio

Alexandre wrote his first code at 14 years old. First an IRC client (from mIRC), then a game built on Open Tibia Server.  
After getting the bachelor degree in Computer Engineering at PUC-Rio, he worked for 8 years as a software engineer.  
He got a scholarship to spend 2 years researching machine learning and applying it to meteorological data and computer poker agents, during a master degree.  
He wrote a framework in Ruby and Python programming languages, to support the creation of Poker bots that can learn as they play against each other.  
With the framework, he created 5 different players and researched how their learning rate differed. The process was detailed in this [dissertation](https://www.maxwell.vrac.puc-rio.br/48011/48011.PDF).  
Founded 2 startups along the way.  
In 2019, he moved to the silicon valley to work as a Senior Software Engineer at [Firework](https://fw.tv).  
After 3 months, he was declared the backend leader, responsible for critical failures, optimizations, reviews on all modifications to the backend source code, recruiting and onboarding new backend developers.  
He scaled the Firework server from 10 to 10000 requests/second, applying multiple optimization techniques.  
He wrote the cache system, responsible to keep the system stable while serving apps and websites of the biggest brazilian TV show on its highest peaks.  
One of his contributions to opensource code got the attention from Ericsson engineers.  
Later, he partnered with them to maintain packages used to power 3G, 4G and 5G networks, of companies such as AT&T, Deutche Telecom, China Telecom, Vodaphone...
The packages are: [eredis](https://github.com/Nordix/eredis) and [eredis_cluster](https://github.com/Nordix/eredis_cluster).  
He has professional experience in Elixir, Phoenix, Erlang, Ruby, Rails, Linux, SQL, Redis, AWS ecosystem, Python and Javascript.  
He also knows server maintenance, but is more interested in reading and writing software.
