# Hey, I'm Alexandre.

  <div class="col-lg-9">
  I've been a software engineer since **2010** and hacker since **2004**. I have a Master's degree in Computer Engineering, where I've researched Algorithms and Machine Learning and applied to meteorological and agribusiness data. Also, I built a <a href="https://github.com/alexandremcosta/pucker/blob/master/doc/tex/thesis.pdf" class="text-blue-700 font-bold">framework</a> for creating poker bots that learn as they play against each other. I founded 2 startups, worked for multiple others. Currently, I am leading the Ads team as a Staff Software Engineer at [Firework.com](https://firework.com).

  My interests include **server-side applications**, **optimization**, **algorithms**, **machine learning**, **recruiting**, **mentoring**. I have professional experience in various technologies including [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/), [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), [Linux](https://www.linux.org/), [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), [Redis](https://redis.io/), [AWS ecosystem](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/). I also have experience in other languages such as [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), [Java](https://www.java.com/), [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).

  When I'm not on my computer, you will find me kitesurfing, playing guitar or having a barbecue with some friends.
