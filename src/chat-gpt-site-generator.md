# ChatGPT wrote a Static Site Generator

<small>
...with my help. **Long story short: I suck at bash scripting.**
</small>

Seriously, I write code for almost 20 years but I never had to learn bash. Judge me!

I was able to find my way around, with long hours of Google, but I had never written a non-trivial script. Also, I got pretty bored trying to read [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) docs, and I wanted a dead simple website.

So I asked ChatGPT ([Jan 9 2023 version](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes)) to build a static site generator in Bash.

Here is the end result, after some iterations:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [[ $1 == "-h" || $1 == "--help" ]]; then
  echo "Usage: ./script.sh layout.html input_dir output_dir"
  echo
  echo "Convert all Markdown files from input_dir to HTML and apply layout.html."
  echo "Replace {{ partial_filename }} in the generated output by the contents the partial file."
  echo "Support subdirectories."
  echo "Non-Markdown files in input_dir are copied to output_dir."
  exit 0
fi

layout=$1
input_dir=$2
output_dir=$3

# Show help if number of params are incorrect, or if they don't exist
[ $# != 3 ] && { sh $0 -h; exit 1; }
[[ -f "$layout" ]] || { echo "Error: Layout does not exist"; exit 1; }
[[ -d "$input_dir" ]] || { echo "Error: Input directory does not exist"; exit 1; }
[[ -d "$output_dir" ]] || { echo "Error: Output directory does not exist"; exit 1; }

# Check if pandoc is installed
hash pandoc 2>/dev/null || { echo >&2 "Error: pandoc is not installed. Please install it to use this script."; exit 1; }

# Iterate through all files in input directory or its subdirectories
find "$input_dir" -type f | while read file; do
  # Get the relative path to the file: remove input_dir from prefix
  relative_path=${file#$input_dir/}

  # Ensure the same directory structure exists in output directory
  file_dir=$(dirname "$output_dir/$relative_path")
  [ -d "$file_dir" ] || mkdir -p "$file_dir"

  if [[ "$file" == *.md ]]; then
    # Convert Markdown to HTML and apply layout
    pandoc --highlight-style tango --quiet "$file" --template "$layout" -o "$output_dir/${relative_path%.md}.html"
  else
    # Copy non-Markdown files to the output directory
    cp "$file" "$output_dir/$relative_path"
  fi
done

# Iterate through all HTML files in output directory or its subdirectories
find $output_dir -name '*.html' | while read file; do
  tmp_file="${file}.tmp"

  # Iterate through each line of the input file
  while read line; do
    # Check if the line contains the string {{ file_name }}, also capture its prefix and suffix
    if [[ $line =~ ^([^\{\{]*)\{\{([^\}]*)\}\}(.*)$ ]]; then
      # Get file_name from regex, strip whitespaces and prefix with output_dir
      file_name=$output_dir/$(echo ${BASH_REMATCH[2]} | tr -d " ")
      # Substitute by the contents of the file, keeping prefix and suffix
      [ -f $file_name ] && line="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}$(cat $file_name)${BASH_REMATCH[3]}"
    fi
    # Append the line to the output file
    printf "%s\n" "$line" >> $tmp_file
  done < $file
  mv $tmp_file $file
done
```

Here is the list of features:

1. Markdown pages with custom HTML layout
1. Standalone HTML pages
1. Supports subdirectories
1. Syntax highlight for code blocks with `tango` colors
1. HTML partials with `{{ partial_filename.html }}`
1. ZERO setup
1. 1 dependency (pandoc)
1. ~60 lines with help section and well commented code

You can check this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alexandremcosta/alexandremcosta.github.io/) to see how I used this simple Static Site Generator to build the website you are reading.

### Useful tips

- Use [entr](https://eradman.com/entrproject/) to rebuild the website when you make changes to HTML and Markdown files:

```bash
$ find . -name '*.html' -o -name '*.md' -o -name '*.sh' | entr ./script.sh layout.html src docs
```

- Start a webserver to have an environment closer to production:  
With this you can use HTTP features of javascript to send HTTP requests.
You have better support for links, for example you can write to `src="/index.html"` on any subdirectory link to refer to the root `/` folder of our server, which is like production.
Finally, it handles assets with the proper content-type.
OSX comes with Ruby, which lets you simply run `cd docs/ && ruby -run -ehttpd . -p8000` to have a server on `localhost:8000`.
Or you can choose any other option from [this list](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255).

- **Deploy your website to GitHub**  
Clone this repository to your website directory. Modify the `src/` markdown and HTML files. Create a repository on GitHub then run this on the directory of your website, changing `username/repository_name` according to what you set on GitHub. Finally, you need to configure GitHub pages on you repository `Settings > Pages` to serve from main branch, from the `docs/` directory.


```bash
# clone this code
$ git clone https://github.com/alexandremcosta/alexandremcosta.github.io.git website/

# make changes to src/ directory...

# generate the website in the docs/ directory
$ sh script.sh src/layout.html src/ docs/

# publish
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "my custom editions"
$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository_name.git
$ git push -u origin main
```

<img src="/assets/gh-pages.png" class="img-fluid">

And *voil√°!* You have a blog online, just like mine, on `https://username.github.io/repository_name`.
To remove the `/repository_name` part, you have to call your repository `username.github.io`.

### A bit more of context

Of course ChatGPT didn't come with this code ready on the first iteration. It was more like:

`PROMPT: write a minimal static site generator in bash script with support to markdown pages and partial templates`

<center><img src="/assets/gpt01.png" class="img-thumbnail" width="400"></center>

`PROMPT: change this script so that pandoc supplies the html layout itself. Also add support for partial templates, for example for any generated html file contains {{ filename }} or {{ another_filenane }} it substitutes this string by the contents of the respective file`

<center><img src="/assets/gpt02.png" class="img-thumbnail" width="400"></center>

Then, I kept testing the result on my machine, fixing ChatGPT errors and iterating with the prompt until we got the final result.
Finally I asked it to write the `--help` flags, improve the comments and reduce some lines that were too verbose.

I knew it was possible to generate a site with Pandoc, but I could never write anything polished like this by myself. Thanks ChatGPT.
